// RECAP:

// When creating and throwing an exception, the exception type must match the intended purpose of the exception as closely as possible.
// To throw an exception, you create an instance of an exception-derived class, configure its properties, and then use the throw keyword.
// When creating an exception object, it's important to provide clear error messages and additional information to help users correct the issue.
